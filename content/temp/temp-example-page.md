# Temp Folder Example Page

This is a sample "temp" page. The URL is decided by the title in the front matter of the markdown file. The `temp_stylesheet:` in the individual markdown front matter points to a corresponding file with the same name in `static/css/temp-stylesheets`, which will pipe the appropriate stylesheet in *after* the site-wild stylesheet in cases where you make want to create one-off pages with URLs at the root of your site. To see why this page is styled differently, refer to `static/css/temp-stylesheets/temp-style-example.css`.
